# ColliderML Benchmark Leaderboard

Six tasks. Beat any metric, earn credits. Reproduce someone else's result,
earn credits. Contribute a baseline, earn credits.

## Tasks

### Physics
1. **tracking** — Track reconstruction on ttbar pu200 (TrackML weighted efficiency, fake/dup rates)
2. **jets** — Jet classification on ttbar pu0 (b-tag AUC, flavour rejections)
3. **anomaly** — BSM anomaly detection on mixed SM/BSM events (AUROC, signal efficiency @ 1% FPR)

### Systems
4. **tracking_latency** — Wall-clock time to process the eval split
5. **tracking_small** — Best efficiency under a parameter budget (three tiers)
6. **data_loading** — Throughput of `colliderml.load()` and downstream iteration

## How to submit

1. Sign in with HuggingFace.
2. Choose a task tab.
3. Upload your predictions as a Parquet file.
4. The server re-scores with the held-out truth and awards credits for any
   metric that beats the current best.

## Reproduction

Every leaderboard row has a **reproduce** button. Run the original
submitter's code yourself, upload your own predictions, and if you land
within 2% on every metric you earn 20 credits. This is the self-policing
mechanism that keeps the leaderboard honest.
