# ColliderML Model Zoo

Browse models tagged `colliderml` on HuggingFace. Upload your own by
adding the `colliderml` tag to your model card.

## Curation

Models are discovered automatically via `huggingface_hub.list_models(filter="colliderml")`.
If you want your model shown here, add the following to your model card:

```yaml
---
tags:
- colliderml
task_category: object-detection   # or whatever applies
---
```

The zoo sorts by download count by default. You can also filter by
task (`tracking`, `jets`, `anomaly`).
